# IT-CODE-Challenge

The IT Code Challenge is a joint initiative between the ULM IT Department and the GDSC at ULM. This challenge is designed to allow students to solve real-life web-related problems derived from the WebTeamâ€™s projects. The aim is to give students hands-on experience in software development, focusing on standards, accessibility, and functionality.
