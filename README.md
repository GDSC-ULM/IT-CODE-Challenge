## Question

In this coding challenge, you'll build an Alumni Search Directory, where users can find and connect with alumni across various industries. The solution could be a website, or app, but must be easy to access. The directory includes profiles with personal, professional, and business details, helping users access contacts, services, or alumni discounts.  
  
  
Your project will be judged on functionality and outcome. You may use any technology but ensure to include README.md or README.txt explaining your tech stack and project setup.
