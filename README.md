## <p id="question">Question</p>

In this coding challenge, you'll build an Alumni Search Directory, where users can find and connect with alumni across various industries. The solution could be a website, or app, but must be easy to access. The directory includes profiles with personal, professional, and business details, helping users access contacts, services, or alumni discounts.  
  
  
Your project will be judged on functionality and outcome. You may use any technology but ensure to include README.md or README.txt explaining your tech stack and project setup. 

#### <p id="sample">Sample ReadMe File:</p>
I have used Django for this project. Below are the steps to run my project:
  
**Step 1:** python manage.py runserver 

**Step 2:** run mobile app using flutter run 

**Step 3:** .. 

**Step 4:** .. 

I used the given URL to retrieve the dataset, and my output is entirely based on this data. If the dataset changes in the future, my solution will still function as expected. 


## <p id="dataset">How to get the dataset?</p>

To complete this challenge, you are provided with a dataset, which can be accessed at: [Click Here for Link](https://bit.ly/3XRzI68)
